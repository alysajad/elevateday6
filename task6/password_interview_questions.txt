Password Security Interview Questions and Answers

1. WHAT MAKES A PASSWORD STRONG?

A strong password has four key characteristics:

Length: At least 15-20 characters minimum. Length is the most important factor because each additional character exponentially increases the time needed to crack the password.

Character Diversity: Uses all four character types:
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Uppercase letters (A-Z) 
- Numbers (0-9)
- Special symbols (!@#$%^&*)

Unpredictability: Avoids common patterns, dictionary words, personal information, sequential patterns (123, abc), and keyboard patterns (qwerty).

Uniqueness: Each account should have its own unique password to prevent credential stuffing attacks.

Example: A 24-character password with full complexity can take 25 million trillion trillion years to crack, while a simple 13-character password might be cracked in 2.52 seconds.

2. WHAT ARE COMMON PASSWORD ATTACKS?

Brute Force Attacks:
- Method: Systematically trying every possible character combination
- Defense: Use long, complex passwords that make this computationally infeasible
- Impact: Time increases exponentially with password length and complexity

Dictionary Attacks:
- Method: Using pre-compiled lists of common passwords and dictionary words
- Defense: Avoid real words, use random character combinations
- Statistics: Highly successful against passwords based on common words

Hybrid Attacks:
- Method: Combining dictionary words with numbers and symbols
- Defense: Use truly random combinations rather than predictable modifications
- Example: "Password123!" appears complex but is easily cracked

Social Engineering:
- Method: Gathering personal information to guess passwords
- Defense: Never use personal information like names, birthdays, or addresses
- Prevention: Use completely unrelated, random password content

Credential Stuffing:
- Method: Using leaked password databases to try combinations across multiple sites
- Defense: Use unique passwords for every account

3. WHY IS PASSWORD LENGTH IMPORTANT?

Password length is the most critical security factor because:

Mathematical Impact:
- Each additional character multiplies the number of possible combinations
- 8-character password (full complexity): 94^8 = ~6 quadrillion combinations
- 16-character password (full complexity): 94^16 = ~4.7 x 10^31 combinations

Exponential Security Growth:
- Doubling password length doesn't double security - it exponentially increases it
- A 16-character password is trillions of times more secure than an 8-character password

Real-World Impact:
- Short passwords can be cracked in seconds or minutes
- Long passwords can take centuries or millennia to crack
- Modern computing power makes short passwords obsolete

Time vs. Length Relationship:
- 8 characters: Hours to days
- 12 characters: Years to decades  
- 16+ characters: Centuries to millennia

4. WHAT IS A DICTIONARY ATTACK?

A dictionary attack is a password cracking method that uses pre-compiled lists of common passwords and dictionary words.

How It Works:
- Attackers use databases containing millions of common passwords
- These lists include dictionary words, common passwords, and previously breached passwords
- The attack systematically tries each word/password from the list
- Much faster than brute force because it focuses on likely passwords

Common Dictionary Sources:
- Real dictionary words in multiple languages
- Previously breached password databases
- Common password patterns (Password123, admin, 123456)
- Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf)
- Personal information patterns

Defense Strategies:
- Avoid dictionary words entirely
- Use random character combinations
- Add complexity that can't be easily predicted
- Use passphrases with random words and modifications
- Never use common passwords from "worst passwords" lists

Success Rate:
- Dictionary attacks succeed against 60-80% of weak passwords
- They fail against truly random, complex passwords
- They're often the first attack method tried due to high success rate

5. WHAT IS MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION?

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account.

The Three Authentication Factors:

Something You Know (Knowledge Factor):
- Passwords, PINs, security questions
- Most common but weakest when used alone

Something You Have (Possession Factor):
- Smartphone apps (Google Authenticator, Authy)
- Hardware tokens, smart cards
- SMS codes (less secure due to SIM swapping)

Something You Are (Inherence Factor):
- Fingerprints, facial recognition
- Retina scans, voice recognition
- Behavioral biometrics

Benefits of MFA:
- Dramatically reduces successful attacks (99.9% reduction according to Microsoft)
- Protects against password breaches
- Provides additional security layer even with weak passwords
- Required by many compliance standards

Common MFA Methods:
- SMS codes (convenient but vulnerable)
- Authenticator apps (more secure)
- Hardware keys (most secure)
- Biometric verification
- Push notifications

6. HOW DO PASSWORD MANAGERS HELP?

Password managers provide comprehensive password security solutions:

- Browser-built options (Chrome, Firefox)
- Enterprise solutions for businesses

7. WHAT ARE PASSPHRASES?

Passphrases are passwords composed of multiple words, typically longer and more memorable than traditional complex passwords.

Structure and Composition:
- Multiple unrelated words combined together
- Often 4-6 words minimum
- Enhanced with numbers, symbols, and capitalization
- Length typically 20+ characters

Advantages:
- Easier to remember than random character strings
- Naturally long, providing excellent security
- Resistant to dictionary attacks when properly constructed
- Balance between security and memorability

Creation Methods:

Diceware Method:
- Use dice to randomly select words from a word list
- Ensures true randomness in word selection
- Recommended by security experts

Random Word Method:
- Choose completely unrelated words
- Avoid logical connections between words
- Add numbers and symbols for complexity

Examples (Conceptual):
- "Mountain$Coffee9!Dragon2Sky"
- "Purple47@Bicycle!Ocean#Moon"
- "Thunder&Cake3$Robot!Star99"

Best Practices:
- Use 4-6 unrelated words minimum
- Add random numbers and symbols
- Vary capitalization unpredictably
- Avoid phrases from books, movies, or songs
- Make each passphrase unique per account

8. WHAT ARE COMMON MISTAKES IN PASSWORD CREATION?

Personal Information Usage:
- Using names, birthdays, addresses, phone numbers
- Including pet names, family member names
- Incorporating anniversaries or significant dates
- Risk: Easy to guess through social engineering

Dictionary Word Reliance:
- Using single dictionary words as base
- Simple word combinations (password123)
- Foreign language words (still in dictionaries)
- Risk: Vulnerable to dictionary attacks

Predictable Patterns:
- Sequential numbers (123456)
- Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf)
- Letter-to-number substitutions (@=a, 3=e)
- Risk: Pattern-based attacks easily crack these

Password Reuse:
- Using same password across multiple accounts
- Minor variations of the same base password
- Using old passwords with slight modifications
- Risk: One breach compromises all accounts

Insufficient Length:
- Believing 8 characters is sufficient
- Prioritizing complexity over length
- Not understanding exponential security scaling
- Risk: Modern computing can crack short passwords quickly

Poor Storage Practices:
- Writing passwords on sticky notes
- Storing in unsecured digital files
- Sharing passwords via email or text
- Risk: Physical and digital exposure

Overconfidence in Complexity:
- Believing special characters alone provide security
- Using complex but short passwords
- Ignoring the importance of randomness
- Risk: Sophisticated attacks bypass simple complexity

Neglecting Updates:
- Never changing passwords after breaches
- Using same passwords for years
- Not monitoring for compromised credentials
- Risk: Ongoing exposure to evolving threats
